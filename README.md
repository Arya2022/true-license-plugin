## Installation

Add the following to your `grails-app/conf/BuildConfig`
```
…
plugins {
…
    compile ':true-license-plugin:1.0'
…
}
```

## Usage

* Generate license file:
```
grails generate-license
```
* Start app:
```
grails run-app
```
* Install/verify license at [http://localhost:8080/your_app/license]. If you try to access your app without installing license, you will be redirected to this page.

## Components

* /license-config/privateKey.store - private key file. This never gets included in your WAR. (You should generate your own private/public keys with _keytool_ command. see tips section below)
* /license-config/LicensePrivateConfig.properties - holds all necessary configuration to create a license such as issuer, holder, validity etc. Again not included in WAR
* /conf/publicCerts.store - public key file. This is included in WAR
* /conf/LicensePublicConfig.groovy - holds all necessary information required for the client. Included in WAR
* /conf/LicenseFilter - defines which controllers, actions need to be protected.
* /plugins/true-license-plugin-1.0/controller/LicenseController - Install, verify license
* /plugins/true-license-plugin-1.0/services/LicenseService - Install, verify license

## Tips

* To generate private key:
```
keytool -genkey -alias privatekey -keystore privateKeys.store
```
* To generate public key
```
keytool -export -alias privatekey -file certfile.cer -keystore privateKeys.store

keytool -import -alias publiccert -file certfile.cer -keystore publicCerts.store
```
* The system preferences are stored in the registry in windows and file system (/etc/.java/) in Linux. You may need appropriate permissions to be able to do this.
